##Facts about this project

1. For project to run you have to add your GITHub token in the <BARERTOKEN> space in App.js

2. I used the `repository` query so to get results you must type a `RepoName` and `OwnerName`

3. If I had more time I would have liked to
   - Break this 1 large component into smaller more reusable components
   - Add integration test cases (Cypress)
   - Add some more styling better design and UX
   - Investigate the other querys. I could not seem to find one that let you search github just one one keyword
